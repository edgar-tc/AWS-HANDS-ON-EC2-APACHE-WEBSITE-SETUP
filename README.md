# AWS-HANDS-ON-EC2-APACHE-WEBSITE-SETUP
Hands-on projects in DevOps and cloud computing are key to gaining practical skills and understanding essential concepts. 
I recently worked on a project where I created an EC2 instance using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), without using the AWS Management Console. 
This method gave me a chance to experience the convenience and flexibility of automating cloud infrastructure. 
After setting up the instance, I installed the Apache web server and hosted a website, showcasing the entire web deployment process. 
In this blog post, Iâ€™ll share the steps I took and what I learned from this experience.
